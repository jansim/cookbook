# Pumpkin Pie

![Pumpkin Pie](../../img/Pumpkin Pie.jpg)

## Crust

- 2 and 1/2 cups (315g) **all-purpose flour,** plus more as needed ([spoon & leveled](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2015/07/29/baking-basics-measuring-is-everything/))
- 2 teaspoons **granulated sugar**
- 1 teaspoon **salt**
- 1 cup (230g; 16 Tbsp) **unsalted butter**, chilled and cubed
- 1/2 cup (120ml) **ice water,** plus more as needed



1. Mix the flour, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Add the cubed butter on top.
2. Using a pastry cutter, food processor, or two forks (pastry cutter  is ideal, see post above), cut the butter into the dry ingredients until all flour is coated. You’re looking for pea-sized bits of flour coated  butter. A few larger bits of butter is OK.
3. Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around.  From that, measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water since the ice has melted a  bit. Drizzle the cold water in, 2 Tablespoons (30ml) at a time, and stir after each addition. Stop adding water when the dough comes together  easily and begins to form large clumps. The dough will feel moist and a  little sticky, but not feel overly wet. Do not add any more water than  you need to. I always use about 1/2 cup (120ml) of ice water.
4. Place pie dough on a lightly floured work surface. Using  floured hands, fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully  incorporated into the fats. Form it into a ball. Divide dough in half.  Using your hands, flatten each half into a 1-inch thick disc.
5. Wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 5 days before using in a pie recipe.
6. When rolling out the chilled pie dough discs, use gentle force with  your rolling pin. Start from the center of the disc and work your way  out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands between rolls.  Smooth out the edges if you notice cracks. (See video above.) Keeping  your work surface, rolling pin, and hands lightly floured makes rolling  out easier.
7. Proceed with the pie per your recipe’s instructions.



### Notes

1. **Make Ahead Instructions:** Prepare the pie dough  through step 4 and freeze the discs for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight  in the refrigerator before using in your pie recipe.
2. **Pie Crust Comparison:** Let’s see how this all butter pie crust recipe compares to my favorite [buttery flaky pie crust](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/), which uses a mix of shortening and butter. Due to butter’s high water  content, this all butter pie crust is lighter textured with more defined flakes. As the crust bakes, the butter’s water converts to steam,  creating thousands of deliciously light flakes. It’s also so buttery!  However, because of all this butter, I find that the [shortening and butter pie crust](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/) is a little easier to work with. Shortening has a higher melting point  than butter, so the crust holds its shape wonderfully. Both crusts are  fantastic, but if you are looking to make intricate pie crust designs I  highly recommend my [buttery flaky pie crust](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/).
3. **Try This:** Replacing 1 Tablespoon of ice water with  cold apple cider vinegar creates an even flakier, more tender pie dough. It’s so tasty. Try it!



## Pie



![Making the Filling](../../img/Pumkin Pie WIP.jpg)

- [Homemade pie crust](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2015/07/01/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/) (full recipe makes 2 crusts: 1 for bottom, 1 for leaf decor)
- one 15oz can (about 2 cups; 450g) **pumpkin puree***
- 3 large **eggs**
- 1 and 1/4 cups (250g) packed light or dark **brown sugar**
- 1 Tablespoon (8g) **cornstarch**
- 1/2 teaspoon **salt**
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons **ground cinnamon**
- 1/2 teaspoon **ground ginger***
- 1/4 teaspoon ground or freshly grated **nutmeg***
- 1/8 teaspoon **ground cloves***
- 1/8 teaspoon fresh ground **black pepper**
- 1 cup (240ml) **heavy cream**
- 1/4 cup (60ml) **milk** (I use 1% – any is fine)
- **egg wash:** 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon milk



1. Make the pie crust through step 5 according to [my directions, tips, and pictures](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2015/07/01/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/). Or use store-bought.
2. **For the pumpkin pie filling:** Whisk the pumpkin, 3  eggs, and brown sugar together until combined. Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, cream, and milk. Vigorously  whisk until everything is combined. Filling will be a little thick.
3. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
4. **Roll out the chilled pie crust:** Remove 1 disc of  pie dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a 12-inch circle. Make sure to turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls. Carefully place the dough into a  9-inch pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. With a small and sharp knife, trim the extra overhang of crust and  discard. Crimp the edges with a fork or flute the edges with your  fingers, if desired. Brush edges lightly with egg wash mixture. Line the pie crust with parchment paper. (Crunch up the parchment paper first so that you can easily shape it into the crust.) Fill with [pie weights](https://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Andersons-Baking-Ceramic-Weights/dp/B00004S1BT?ie=UTF8&creativeASIN=B0113L930C&linkCode=xm2&redirect=true&tag=sallsbakiaddi-20). Make sure the weights are evenly distributed around the pie dish.  Pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment  paper/pie weights.
5. Pour pumpkin pie filling into the warm pre-baked crust. Only fill  the crust about 3/4 of the way up. (Use extra to make mini pies with  leftover pie dough scraps if you’d like.) Bake the pie until the center  is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or take. A small part of the  center will be wobbly – that’s ok. After 25 minutes of baking, be sure  to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust  shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown. Check for doneness  at minute 50, and then 55, and then 60, etc.
6. Once done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow to cool  completely for at least 3 hours. Decorate with sugared cranberries and  pie crust leaves (see note). You’ll definitely have leftover cranberries – they’re tasty for snacking. Serve pie with [whipped cream](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2018/10/03/homemade-whipped-cream/) if desired. Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

### Notes

1. **Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions:** Pumpkin pie freezes well, up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before serving. Pie crust dough freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw  overnight in the refrigerator before using. If decorating your pie with  sugared cranberries, start them the night before. You’ll also begin the  pie crust the night before as well (the dough needs at least 2 hours to  chill; overnight is best). The filling can be made the night before as  well. In fact, I prefer it that way. It gives the spices, pumpkin, and  brown sugar flavors a chance to infuse and blend. It’s *awesome.* Cover and refrigerate overnight.
2. **Pumpkin:** Canned pumpkin is best in this pumpkin pie recipe. If using fresh pumpkin puree, lightly blot it before adding to  remove some moisture. The bake time may be longer.
3. **Spices:** About 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice can be used instead of these spices.
4. **Pie Crust:** No matter if you’re using homemade crust or store-bought crust, pre-bake the crust. (Step 5.)
5. **Pie Crust Leaves:** On a floured work surface, roll  out one of the balls of chilled dough (keep the other one in the  refrigerator). Roll out into any shape you really want (doesn’t matter)  and 1/8 inch thickness. Using leaf cookie cutters, cut into shapes.  Brush each lightly with the beaten egg + milk mixture. Cut leaf veins  into leaves using a sharp knife, if desired. Place onto a parchment  paper or silicone baking mat-lined baking sheet and bake at 350°F  (177°C) for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove and set aside to cool before decorating pie.
