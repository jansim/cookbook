- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon white pepper powder
- 3 tablespoons butter (*see footnote 1)
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 3 green onions , chopped
- Salt to taste


1. Combine the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
2. Add the butter into a large nonstick skillet and heat over medium-high heat until melted.
3. Add the eggs. Cook until the bottom is slightly set. Scramble until the eggs are mostly cooked.
4. Add the rice onto the egg. Cook and chop the rice with your spatula, to separate the grains and coat the rice with egg. Cook until the heat builds up and you can hear a vibrant sizzling.
5. Swirl in the soy sauce mixture. Cook and stir constantly, until the rice turns an even color.
6. Add the green onion and stir to mix well.
7. Carefully taste the rice. Season lightly with sea salt if needed. Stir and mix thoroughly, so the salt is evenly dispersed.
8. Transfer the rice to a bowl and serve hot as a side or a light main dish.
