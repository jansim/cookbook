# BBQ cauliflower steaks and herb sauce

![Image of Cauliflower Steaks](../../img/Cauliflower Steaks.jpg)

- for the cauliflower "steaks"
  - 2 cauliflowers, outer leaves removed
  - 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  - 1 tsp caraway seeds
  - 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- for the sauce
  - 30g fresh basil, finely chopped
  - 30g fresh parsley, finely chopped
  - 3 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped
  - 1 green chilli, finely chopped
  - 1-2 lemons


1. Preheat the barbecue. Trim the base of the cauliflowers so that they sit flat, then cut into 2cm-thick slices (see Tip, below).
2. In a small bowl, mix together 3 tbsp of the oil with the caraway seeds and garlic. Season, then brush the oil all over the cauliflower steaks.
3. Cook on the preheated barbecue, away from the main heat, for 5-6 mins on each side until charred and just tender. Alternatively, cook the steaks (2 at a time, depending on their size) in a griddle pan over a medium-low heat for the same time.
4. Meanwhile, mix together the chopped herbs, spring onions, chilli and remaining 3 tbsp of oil in a small bowl. Squeeze in the juice of ½ a lemon and taste – add a little more lemon juice or oil to taste. Season.
5. Drizzle the herb sauce over the steaks and serve with the remaining lemon cut into wedges. 


> BBQ season doesn’t have to just be about meat as these smoky charred cauliflower steaks show. A simple vegan BBQ idea, the steaks are brushed with an aromatic caraway and garlic oil before being grilled and served with a punchy fresh herb dressing. 

> Tip: Cauliflowers may vary in size – try to find 2 the same and aim for about 4 slices from each. Any end bits that are left can be kept for another dish; blitz into cauliflower rice to toss through a salad or add to a traybake of roasted vegetables.
> If you haven’t got caraway seeds, fennel seeds would also work well.
