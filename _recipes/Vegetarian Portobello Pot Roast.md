![Image of Vegetarian Portobello Pot Roast](../img/Vegetarian Portobello Pot Roast.jpg)


- 1.25 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 pound baby bella mushrooms (if they are large, cut them in half)
- 2 large carrots, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 cups frozen pearl onions*
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 3 cups vegetable stock, divided
- 1/2 cup dry red or white wine
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons (vegetarian**) worcestershire
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- Kosher salt and freshly-cracked black pepper
- optional garnish: finely-chopped fresh parsley


1. Add potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, onions, garlic, thyme, 2.5 cups vegetable stock, wine and worcestershire together in the bowl of a pressure cooker, and gently toss to combine.  Close lid securely and set vent to Sealing.
2. Press Manual, then press Pressure until the light on High Pressure lights up, then adjust the up/down arrows until time reads 20 minutes.  Cook.  Then let the pressure release naturally, about 15 minutes.  Carefully turn the vent to Venting, just to release any extra pressure that might still be in there. Remove the lid.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/2 cup vegetable stock and cornstarch until combined. Add to the roast mixture, and gently toss to combine.  Continue to cook for 1-3 minutes, until the sauce thickens up a bit.
4. Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.
