# Vegan Hungarian Goulash

![Image of Vegan Hungarian Goulash](../../img/Vegan Hungarian Goulash.jpg)


- 2 packed cups (320g) finely chopped white onion
- 2 red bell peppers, chopped (270g)
- 6 extra large cloves garlic, minced (18g)
- 2 1/2 - 3 cups (690g) low-sodium broth (amounts added at different times)
- 1 teaspoon fine salt
- 3-5 tablespoons Hungarian Paprika (make sure it&#39;s not smoked (I used 5, but that may be too strong for some, so start with 3 and add more if desired. It&#39;s important to use Hungarian for the best flavor)
- 1/4 cup (60g) dry red wine
- 8 small (560g) red or gold potatoes (do not use russet), chopped into 1/2 inch chunks
- One 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with juices (mine had added salt)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper (and a good pinch of cayenne if you want a kick)


1. Have all of your vegetables chopped and ready to go before beginning, as the cooking process is fairly quick.
2. Add the onion, bell peppers, garlic, JUST 1 cup of the broth and JUST 1/2 teaspoon of the salt to a large pot over medium heat. Once it begins to bubble all over, cook for about 8 minutes until the veggies are tender and all the broth is gone. You want the broth gone before adding the wine, this will keep the sauce thick and not watery at the end.
3. Add the paprika and wine and cook for about 3 minutes.
4. Add the potatoes, tomatoes, pepper, another 1/2 teaspoon salt and the remaining broth. Start out with 1 1/2 cups and add more if desired or needed to cook the potatoes. I used the full 2 cups because my potatoes needed it and I wanted it a bit saucy. Stir well and turn the heat to high. Once it comes to a boil, cover and lower the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are tender, but not mushy. Taste and add any more seasoning if needed.
5. Serve immediately either as is or over white rice.

> Eat as a stew or with rice.
