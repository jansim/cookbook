- 4 large baking potatoes
- 11/2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon seasoning (lemon pepper, seasoning salt, or your favorite seasoning blend)
- 2 teaspoons sugar


1. Preheat oven to 40
2. Wash potatoes leaving skin on (you can peel them if you prefer).Fill a bowl with cold water. Slice potatoes into 3-4 slices length wise and then into strips.
3. Let potatoes soak in cold water for at least 30 minutes (this removes starch from the potato resulting in crispier french fries).
4. Remove from water and pat dry.Toss with oil, sugar and seasoning.
5. Bake for 30 minutes. Turn fries and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes.
