![Image of Sweet Potatoes with Thai Peanut Butter Sauce](../../img/Sweet Potatoes with Thai Peanut Butter Sauce.jpg)

- Potatoes
  - 4 medium to large sweet potatoes (10 to 12 ounces each)
  - 1 cup of water
- Slaw
  - 1/2 red bell pepper
  - 1/2 yellow bell pepper
  - 1 green onion
  - 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
  - 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (1 lime)
  - 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
  - Crushed peanuts, for the garnish
- Sauce
  - 1/3 cup peanut butter
  - 2 tablespoons soy sauce
  - 2 tablespoons lime juice (1 lime)
  - 1 teaspoon maple syrup
  - 2 tablespoons water

## Main Recipe
1. Cook the sweet potatoes using our Instant Pot Sweet Potatoes recipe (see below, takes about 35 minutes total; make the remainder of the recipe during this time!). Or, to bake the sweet potatoes: Slice the sweet potatoes in half. Preheat the oven to 400F and rub the halved sweet potatoes with the olive oil on all sides.
2. Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes (or more, depending on the size of the potato), or until very tender to the touch. Set aside.
3. Make the slaw: Thinly slice the red cabbage, enough for 3 cups. Thinly slice the peppers. Thinly slice the green onion. Chop the cilantro. In a large bowl, mix together the cabbage, peppers, green onion and cilantro with the lime juice and kosher salt.
4. Make the Thai peanut butter sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, maple syrup, and water. Taste and add a bit of kosher salt if desired (this depends on the salt content of the peanut butter).
5. To serve: Slice the sweet potatoes in half and top them with the slaw.
6. Drizzle with the Thai peanut butter sauce and sprinkle with chopped peanuts.

## Instant Pot Sweet Potatoes
1. Scrub the sweet potatoes. Place the stainless steel trivet into the Instant Pot, then place the potatoes on top. Add 1 cup water.
2. Lock the lid of the Instant Pot. Place the pressure release handle (vent) in the “Sealing” position.
3. Cook on high pressure 16 minutes: Press the Pressure Cook button, making sure the “High Pressure” setting is selected, and set the time for 16 minutes. It takes about 10 minutes for the pot to “preheat” and come up to pressure before it starts cooking. Wait while the Instant Pot cooks. (Note: During cooking, avoid touching the metal part of the lid.)
4. Natural release for 10 minutes: After the Instant Pot beeps, wait for another 10 minutes to let the Instant Pot naturally release pressure. (Tip: We set a timer for this part so we don’t forget!) After 10 minutes, vent any remaining steam by moving the vent to “Venting”, covering your hand with a towel or hot pad. Never put your hands or face near the vent when releasing steam. (The pressure indicator in the lid may drop on its own after 10 minutes, meaning that there is no remaining steam in the pot.)
5. Open the lid and carefully remove the hot sweet potatoes with tongs. Serve immediately, or store in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.
